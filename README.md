# CMPG-323-Overview-27644227

### **The project will consist of 5 smaller projects that is as follow:**

* Project 1: Agile & Scrum
* Project 2: API Development
* Project 3: Web App Project Testing Patterns
* Project 4: RPA & Testing Project
* Project 5: Reporting Project

Each of the projects will be submited at a due date. Projects have related tasks that is placed in sprints format. These tasks must be done before the work is done on the project as it acts as trainning to be able to do the projects.

### **The Related tasks is categorised as follow:**

* Training
* Classes

### Each Task has the following Attributes per tick logged:

* Label (To Identify the type of task)
* Milestone (Indicates towards what goal is the task contributing)
* Linked Assesment (Indicates towards what project is the task contributing)
* Sprint (Indicates in which set of two weeks time must the task be done)
* Effort (How much time must be spent on a task to be completed)
* Due Date (Specifies the date when the task must be finished)

### Views of the project:

#### The Project has four views to manage and track the progress of the project:

* Tabular View
* Linked Assessments View
* Sprint View
* Traditional Kanban View
* Training

### Branching strategy of the Project

The Project will use a trunk based branching stategy 

<image src ="/trunk-based-development-branching-strategy.png" width="600"/>

Trunk Based branching uses the approach to have one main master branch and the user only branches out for a single feature per branch. While the master branch is always ready for production.

Reasoning for the selected branching strategy is it keeps the merging of branches simple it helps to keep the code relavant by doing frequent and small merges

### Git Ignore

Git ignore will be used to exclude dependencies and compiled files that is not necessary to be on the repositry. For every file in the project that is not necessary those files would be deleted once and then add a git ignore for that file. So that we do not need to by hand delete the same file over and over when a commit was pushed to the project's master branch.  

### Repositries OutLine 

The Repositories consist of 5 seperate repositories as the following(Click on the links to navigate to the repositories):

* CMPG-323-Overview-27644227
* [CMPG-323-API Development-27644227](https://github.com/Wessel373/Wessel373-CMPG-323-API-Development-27644227)
* [CMPG-323-Web App Project Testing Patterns-27644227](https://github.com/Wessel373/Project_3-CMPG-323-IOT-Device-Management-27644227)
* [CMPG-323-RPA & Testing Project-27644227](https://github.com/Wessel373/CMPG-323-RPA-Testing-Project-27644227)
* [CMPG-323-Reporting Project-27644227](https://github.com/Wessel373/CMPG-323-Reporting-Project-27644227)



### How will credentials be stored:

* The user's credentials or login name will be stored as a String value to be compared on when login process is initiated.

* Password wil not be stord just as plain text it will be stored as hash values so when the user try to login the userinput will be hashed and the hashed values will be compared.
